# HostTierList
A Repository for Minecraft Hosting Tierlists with pros and cons
Note that all the price ranges are based on the fixed plan itself or the "RAM slide", check for additional storage/threads on your own as keeping track of all that is difficult.

### Definitions:
- Single Thread Rating: it's a rating sourced from Passmark's website. **The higher the value, the better**.
- Scalable Threads: The more ram you buy, the more cores you get too. Example: 4GB plan comes with 2 vCores, 8GB plan comes with 3 vCores
- Dedicated Cores: as the name says, cores dedicated to you, so, other servers on the same node don't affect you.
- GDPR compliant: Explicit statement compliance with GDPR from the Executives of the Company/Organization. (Even though every business doing sales with EU citizens __should__ be compliant)

### Emoji Definitions:
- ❌ No/Doesn't Have
- ⚠️ Not confirmed yet/not sure
- ✅ Yes/Has it
