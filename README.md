# Host List

Hey there, am Melon, the author of this repository. Every host here has either been added by me, because of personal choice, suggestion by a friend, or it has been added through the request of a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Melon-Oof/HostList/issues). Everything within the table is as objective as it gets. If you need __FREE__ Minecraft Hosting, I suggest you to check out [Myuui's repo](https://github.com/Myuui/Free-Minecraft-Hosts).


> ### **Important**: 
> - The price ranges are based on the fixed plan itself or the "RAM slide".
> - Additionally, the CPUs are most likely AMD Ryzen, else their (partially) full model will be mentioned (in a way that it can be recognized).
> - The hosts are listed in an unordered way, **there's no "best" host**, just the __most fitting to your use case__.
>
> - Do note that am human and there are possibly some mistakes here and there. Open a github issue if you find any.
> - Do note also that some providers, or their providers undervolt (lower performance) the cpu.
> - The information listed down here is sourced from the websites of the services/their executives.

> [!NOTE]
> - CPU: The range of CPUs from weakest to best (single thread rating based), in __ANY__ of the plans and/or locations.
> - Price/GB: It's based off the monthly pricing of the plan, without any discount and/or additional addons.
> - Single Thread Rating: it's a rating sourced from [Passmark's website](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/). **The higher the value, the better**.
> - Scalable Threads: The more ram you buy, the more cores you get, free of charge. Example: 4GB plan comes with 2 vCores, 8GB plan comes with 3 vCores
> - Dedicated Cores: as the name says, cores dedicated to you, so, other servers on the same node don't affect you.
> - GDPR compliant: Explicit statement compliance with GDPR from the Executives/Legal Docs of the Company/Organization. (Even though every business doing sales with EU citizens __should__ be compliant)
> - Notes: The notes column is used for outstanding/out of the norm characteristics of the hosting, or any additional information the end-user should be aware of. Be it good or bad.
